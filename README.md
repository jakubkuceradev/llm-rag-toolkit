# llm-rag-toolkit
This project is a toolkit for building modular Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. It serves as a practical guide and framework for creating a conversational chatbot that answers questions grounded in a specific knowledge base.  To serve as an example, a RAG system indexing and chunking HTML and PDF lecture notes is built.
